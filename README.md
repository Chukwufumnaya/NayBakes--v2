### Features

* **Dynamic Customization Modal:** Implemented a two-step "Add to Cart" process where the initial click opens a dedicated modal to select modifications for that particular item, if available, e.g. size, milk type, etc. Also ensures the cart receives the modified menu items.
* **Realistic Time Slot Generation:** Checkout includes logic to generate sensible pickup times based on the current time, a 15-minute prep time and the cafe's opening and closing hours.
* **Printable Order Ticket:** The final step generates a styled, print-ready receipt with a unique Order ID and scheduled pickup time, utilizing CSS Print Media Queries to hide site navigation and focus only on the receipt content.
* **Responsive Design:** Built using Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across mobile and desktop devices.
